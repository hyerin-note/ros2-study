# ROS2 Study (Jazzy)

This repository contains my ROS2 learning progress and practice.

## Environment
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 (WSL2)
- ROS2: Jazzy Jalisco

## What I have done
- Installed ROS2 Jazzy
- Ran turtlesim
- Controlled turtle using teleop
- Observed topics: /turtle1/cmd_vel, /turtle1/pose
- Visualized node-topic structure using rqt_graph

## Next Steps
- Write my own ROS2 node in Python
- Publish cmd_vel programmatically
